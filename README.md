<p>TalentStack is a web application designed to connect entrepreneurs with similar ideas and interests. Although this is a project in the making, originally used as my capstone project for the Actualize bootcamp, the hope is to polish this full-stack application so that users can sign up and post their ideas to receive feedback, advice and potentially find others interested in helping them pursue their vision.</p>

<p>This application uses the Ruby on Rails and Vue.js frameworks.</p>
